	TX Transceiver data rate of 2.5 Gbps
	TX controller use the clock output from transceiver IP

	Seprate version for different FE boards (with different port connections)

	Revision for the newly received FE board, currently use TX port 3

170113:
	Use 2 TX ports on the FE board to send 2 sets of data simutaniously to BE
	(As the other board is not working, using this method to test multiple channle receiving on BE)

	The schematic of Serdes board on Board 3 is different from Board 1. The TX port gives nothing. Need the correct board schematic.

	The new board should be working by now, use F1 design just changing TX ports
	All 4 channels sending at the same time and works!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
